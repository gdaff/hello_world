Hi I'm learning coding. I've taken some Fortran and Pascal courses in the past and taught myself some HTML, but I have done any structed training.  I'm not your traditional student trying to learn code.  I'm a retired 66 year old male.  I felt like I would like to go back to work but didn't want to be a greeter at Walmart. I've spent over 15 years in Desktop/Helpdesk support with no formal training, just picking things up by reading books and flying by the seat of my pants.  So here I go, hopefully the gray matter is up to the challenge.
